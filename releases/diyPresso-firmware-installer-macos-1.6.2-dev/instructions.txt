1) Download and unpack the zip file.

2) Turn OFF the diyPresso machine with the switch at the back. During updating the controller will be powered via the USB connection.

3) Get your USB cable ready, but do not yet connect it to your computer.

4) Open the Terminal app

5) Go to the directory where you unpacked the script. E.g.:
        cd ~/Downloads/diyPresso-firmware-installer-macos-1.6.2-dev
6) Start the script with:
        /upload.sh

7) Follow the instruction on screen. Do not press any button on the diyPresso machine during updating. The script starts with downloading some needed tooling, which can take while.

6) After the script is completed, you can disconnect the USB cable and power on your diyPresso machine.

Enjoy your coffee!
